JSON Schemas allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents, YAML file type is also possible; this last relies on the JSON Schema specifications.

## YAML

If you ned an automatic binding of "La Rebelion" YAML files with corresponding schema you can use [in-file declaration](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/25/how-to-configure-yaml-schema-to-make-editing-files-easier#schema_association_without_a_file_name_pattern), as an example:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schemas.rebelion.la/dev-conf-v1.0.json
```
